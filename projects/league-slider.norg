*_League Slider_*

* _TODO_
  -- ( ) Team pop-up on click
  --- ( ) When the user clicks the row of a specific team, a pop-up appears
  --- ( ) The pop-up contains a chart that displays their historical standings in the currently selected league
  --- ( ) Add configuration to the chart, i.e. display goals or pts etc. instead of standings
  -- ( ) Menubar at top of league
  --- ( ) Tidy up menubar above league display
  --- ( ) Allow users to filter by league, Away/Home
  -- ( ) Introduce more leagues to the app
  --- ( ) Championship
  --- ( ) League 1
  --- ( ) League 2

* _Ideas_
  - Add player stats
  - Add xg analysis
